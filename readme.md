# Steam Deck CEC Services Installer
This script will install both a wake and sleep service to have the Steam Deck
automatically turn the tv on or off when waking or suspending the Deck,
respectively. 

To install, simply clone this repository and run `sudo bash ./install.sh`.

This script is based on godver3's scripts posted on
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1am67qp/hdmicec_information/).
